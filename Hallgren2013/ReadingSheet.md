Hallgren (2014) describes the benefits of using simulations and provides examples of applications.

1)	Please list all the words that you do not know/concepts you do not understand in this paper (except mediation, branching, zero-inflation, ceiling effect, structural equation models, social network exponential random graph).  
    *  bootstrapping
    *  
    *  

2) In your own words, describe which steps are common to all sorts of simulations. Illustrate with simple examples rather than, or in addition to, using terms such as assumptions and parameters.    
**1)**  We start by making assumptions about our data of interest
**2)**  A random dataset is generated
**3)**  Statistical analysis performed on this random dataset to generate results we are interested in
**4)**  Repeat of step 2 and 3 to generate large amounts of stimulations
**5)**  Re-make assumption and re-repeat of large amount of itteration
**6)**  We obtain different estimate from different assumptions and we evaluate



3)	In your own words, describe the 3 types of applications for simulations covered by the author.  
**1)**  To understand a relationship by exploring how one variable influences another variable through a mediator variable.
**2)**  Estimating the Statistical Power of a Model 
**3)**  Bootstrapping can be used as an alternative to the Sobel test to obtain a more accurate confidence interval

4)	Describe, with your own words and/or examples, the 4 limitations to simulations mentioned by the author.  
**1)** Real-world data often do not adhere to the assumptions and parameters by which data are generated in simulation studies
**2)** The true population parameters that are incorporated into simulation studies are hidden
**3)** Considerable computation power required for large itterations
**4)** Many statistical questions canbe answered through mathematical derivations and does not require simulation
